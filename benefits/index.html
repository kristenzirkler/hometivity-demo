      <h3>Can I Do This Myself?</h3>
      <p>Sure, you could make extra principal payments on your own, but the fact is that few people actually do. EMPP makes it easy and automatic, and what's more, you never again need to write a check or mail a payment. We debit your account every other week according to the schedule that's most convenient for you. Then we make sure your payment arrives at your mortgage company on time â€” every time.</p>

      <h3>What Are My Options?</h3>
      <p>Although homeowners throughout the country are turning to biweekly mortgage plans to build equity and reduce the costs of owning a home, all biweekly plans are not created equal. Enrollment fees can run as high as $500 for programs offered by many mortgage companies and mortgage payment processing firms. Moreover, these programs can charge electronic transaction fees up to $10 per month. Some plans are not affiliated with any bank, lender or other reputable organization, even though they may claim to be.</p>
      <p>With EMPP, however, you can reduce your mortgage interest expense and build equity faster with minimal effort and cost. With our deferred enrollment fee option you pay nothing up front, and our biweekly transaction fees are the lowest around. What's more, EMPP is a pioneer of biweekly mortgage acceleration programs, and through its business relationships with leading mortgage lenders and banks it has offered its superior program to millions of homeowners over the past 15 years. EMPP's experience in administering mortgage acceleration programs is unequaled, and we're proud of our long record of helping people from all walks of life save thousands of dollars on their mortgage, and providing exceptional customer service in the process.</p>
      <p>Only EMPP offers the right combination of features and advantages that will ensure thousands of dollars in savings on your mortgage. </p>
