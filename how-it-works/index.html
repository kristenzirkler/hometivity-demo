        <h2>How Does EMPP Work?</h2>

        <p>EMPP makes it simple for you to pay off your mortgage years early and save up to tens of thousands of dollars in interest. Here’s how it works:</p>

        <h3>The Process</h3>
        <ul class="numer">
            <li>
                <h4><strong class="numer">1)</strong>You sign up for the Early Mortgage Pay-Off Plan.</h4>
                <p>Joining EMPP is simple. Complete the secure online enrollment form. All we need is some basic information about yourself, your mortgage lender and the bank account you want to use for the automatic withdrawals. We work with every mortgage lender and every bank – you don’t have to change anything about any of your accounts.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4><strong class="numer">2)</strong>We draft a half payment every two weeks.</h4>
                <p>Every other week, we debit your account for half of your current monthly mortgage payment amount. Because there are 52 weeks in a year, that adds up to 26 half payments or 13 full payments over the course of the year. Because you're making the equivalent of 13 mortgage payments every year, the additional amount is applied as extra principal, <a href="CalcSavings.aspx">saving you literally thousands of dollars</a> in interest over time. We can even draft semi-monthly (on the 15th and last days of the month) instead of biweekly if that works better with your pay schedule.<br> &nbsp;<br>

            </li>
            <li>
                <h4><strong class="numer">3)</strong>We make your monthly mortgage payment automatically.</h4>
                <p>Every month, we make your mortgage payment for you, on time, every time. You never have to write another mortgage check or remember to make your payment. And because of the biweekly draft schedule, twice during each calendar year we'll apply an extra half payment directly to your mortgage's principal balance, thereby reducing your overall interest payments.</p>

        <h3>EMPP Works for You</h3>
        <p>Many biweekly programs charge high enrollment and transaction fees. Not EMPP. Over the past 15 years, we have learned how to reduce the costs involved in managing a biweekly program to the bare minimum, without compromising on security and customer service. Then we pass the cost savings on to our customers. Our goal has always been, and will continue to be, to enable average homeowners with mortgages to save money and reduce debt. Our flexible enrollment options take all the pain out of starting a biweekly program, and we only charge a nominal $1.50 transaction fee per biweekly draft — about half of an average ATM fee.</p>
