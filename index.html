      <h3>What is the Early Mortgage Pay-Off Plan?<sup>&reg;</sup></h3>
      <p>The <strong>Early Mortgage Pay-Off Plan (<span class="empp">EMPP</span>)</strong> is an automatic mortgage acceleration program that helps you pay off your mortgage years ahead of schedule, saving you thousands of dollars in interest and effectively reducing your mortgage interest rate.</p>
      <p>This is possible because <span class="empp">EMPP</span> achieves the same result as you would if you made extra principal payments on your mortgage, but <span class="empp">EMPP</span> does it for you, simply and automatically. What's more, <span class="empp">EMPP</span> is guaranteed to save you thousands of dollars in mortgage interest, <strong>no matter where you bank or who your lender is</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong><span class="empp">EMPP</span> is not a gimmick.</strong> It's the disciplined approach to paying off your mortgage.</p>

        <h3>How Can <span class="empp">EMPP</span><sup>&reg;</sup> Help Me?</h3>
        <p>When you enroll in the Early Mortgage Pay-Off Plan, you'll be able to:</p>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li><strong>Save thousands in interest.</strong> Pay off your mortgage faster by making the equivalent of an extra payment each year, reducing the interest you pay over the life of your loan. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/calculate-savings">Find out how much you can save</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Increase home equity.</strong> Those added payments toward your principal increase your equity – the amount you own in your home.</li>
            <li><strong>Accelerate mortgage payoff.</strong> You can own your home, mortgage-free, years ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li><strong>Simplify bill paying.</strong> Never write another mortgage payment check. Automated payments are timed to match your pay schedule.</li>
            <li><strong>Eliminate late payments.</strong> Your mortgage payment will arrive on time, without fail, month after month – no late fees, ever.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How Does EMPP<sup>&reg;</sup> Work?</h3>
        <p>The idea is quite simple. With EMPP, you make a payment equal to half your current monthly mortgage payment every two weeks. That’s 26 half payments each year, or the equivalent of 13 monthly payments.</p>
        <p>The extra amount you pay goes directly toward your mortgage principal balance and reduces your mortgage interest. And with EMPP, it’s easy and automatic.</p>
